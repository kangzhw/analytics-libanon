Building
==========

  If while compiling you get an error similar to this

      libtool: Version mismatch error.  This is libtool 2.4 Debian-2.4-2,but the 
      libtool: definition of this LT_INIT comes from libtool 2.2.6b.
      libtool: You should recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from libtool 2.4 Debian-2.4-2
      libtool: and run autoconf again.

  then follow these steps:
    
    1) make maintainer-clean
    2) rm -f aclocal.m4 configure Makefile.in config.h config.h.in config.status libtool ltmain.sh
    3) rm -rf m4 autom4te.cache
    3) autoreconf ; ./configure ; make
